# THE EVALUATION PROCESS

Assessment is quite a new area in the language teaching and learning
field, although people have been assessed for many years, in different
areas of their educational and professional activities. Nowadays,
assessment isn't just about teachers; test creators, publishers, and
researchers are increasingly interested in finding ways to assess
effectively and automatically. Their findings inevitably have an impact
on how languages are taught, learned, and tested. Originally, assessment
was mainly about testing what students already knew. However, in recent
decades, there's been a change from assessing what students have
learned to assessing how they learn.

The evaluation process involves systematically assessing students'
performance, understanding, and skills to measure their progress and
achievement in relation to learning objectives. Here's a breakdown of
the evaluation process:

**1. Setting Clear Learning Objectives:**

Learning objectives in an English as a Foreign Language context can be
made more effective by using the SMART criteria. SMART stands for
Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound.

Here's how you can apply these criteria to ESL learning objectives:

1. **Specific**: Objectives should be clear and specific to avoid
misunderstanding about what is expected.

2. **Measurable**: Ensure that the objective can be assessed and
measured.

3. **Achievable**: Set realistic goals that are attainable for the
students given their current level and available resources.

4. **Relevant**: Align objectives with the learners' needs and
real-life use of English.

5. **Time-bound**: Specify a time frame in which the objective should
be achieved.

**Examples of SMART Learning Objectives for EFL**

1. Specific: Students will learn and use 10 new business-related
vocabulary terms.

-   Measurable: Students will correctly use at least 8 out of the 10
    > terms in a role-play activity.

-   Achievable: Given the intermediate level of the class, 10 terms are
    > manageable.

-   Relevant: These terms will help students in business settings,
    > aligning with their career goals.

-   Time-bound: This objective will be achieved within the two-week
    > business English unit.

2. Specific: Students will practise pronunciation of the past tense
endings \"-ed.\"

-   Measurable: By the end of the lesson, students will pronounce the
    > \"-ed\" ending correctly in 90% of given verbs during a reading
    > exercise.

-   Achievable: The students have already been introduced to regular
    > past tense verbs.

-   Relevant: Proper pronunciation is crucial for clear communication.

-   Time-bound: This objective will be achieved by the end of the
    > current week.

3. Specific: Students will write a formal email.

-   Measurable: The email will include all required parts (greeting,
    > body, closing) and follow proper format with less than 3
    > grammatical errors.

-   Achievable: Students have been practising email writing in previous
    > lessons.

-   Relevant: Email writing is a common real-world skill necessary for
    > personal and professional communication.

-   Time-bound: This task will be completed by the end of the lesson.

By setting SMART objectives, ESL teachers can create clear, achievable,
and meaningful goals that help students make measurable progress in
their language learning journey.

**2. Choosing Assessment Methods:**

-   Teachers select appropriate assessment methods based on the learning
    > objectives and the nature of the content.

-   Common assessment methods include:

-   Formative Assessment: Ongoing assessments during the learning
    > process to provide feedback and guide instruction.

-   Summative Assessment: Evaluations conducted at the end of a unit,
    > semester, or year to measure overall learning outcomes.

-   Performance-Based Assessment: Tasks or projects where students
    > demonstrate their understanding and skills in real-world contexts.

-   Standardised Testing: Formal assessments with predetermined
    > questions and scoring criteria used for comparison across students
    > or schools.

-   Peer Assessment: Students evaluate each other's work based on
    > established criteria.

-   Self-Assessment: Students reflect on their own learning and
    > performance.

-   Portfolios: Collections of student work that demonstrate progress
    > and achievement over time.

**3. Developing Assessment Criteria:**

-   Clear assessment criteria or rubrics are developed to communicate
    > expectations to students and ensure consistency in evaluation.

-   Rubrics outline specific criteria and performance levels for each
    > criterion.

**4. Administering Assessments:**

-   Teachers administer assessments according to the chosen methods.

-   During formative assessments, educators provide feedback to students
    > to support their learning.

-   For summative assessments, educators ensure fair and standardised
    > administration.

**5. Collecting and Analysing Data:**

-   Data from assessments are collected and analysed to evaluate student
    > performance.

-   Educators may use various data analysis techniques to identify
    > trends, strengths, and areas for improvement.

**6. Providing Feedback:**

-   Feedback is provided to students based on their performance.

-   Feedback should be specific, constructive, and timely.

-   Formative feedback helps students understand their strengths and
    > areas needing improvement.

-   Summative feedback summarises overall performance and may include
    > suggestions for future learning.

**7. Using Evaluation Results:**

-   Evaluation results inform instructional decisions.

-   Educators use data to adjust teaching strategies, modify learning
    > activities, and provide additional support where needed.

-   Results may also be used for reporting to stakeholders such as
    > parents, administrators, or educational authorities.

**8. Continuous Improvement:**

-   The evaluation process is repetitive, and feedback from assessments
    > informs future instructional planning.

-   Educators continuously review and refine assessment methods and
    > criteria to improve the learning experience for students.

# OVERVIEW OF COMMON EVALUATION STRATEGIES USED IN ENGLISH AS A FOREIGN LANGUAGE (EFL) TEACHING

## Evaluation Strategies

> *Evaluation strategies* refer to the systematic approaches and methodologies employed to assess the effectiveness, progress, and
outcomes of the learning process. These strategies involve planning and implementing a variety of assessment techniques to gather comprehensive
information about students' knowledge, skills, and competencies in a specific subject area. Evaluation strategies are designed to align with
educational goals, provide meaningful feedback, and guide instructional decisions.

As defined by [Rodríguez e Ibarra](https://www.elsevier.es/es-revista-perfiles-educativos-85-articulo-medios-tecnicas-e-instrumentos-evaluacion-S0185269815000100) (2011), assessment *tools* are real and tangible instruments used by the person in charge of assessing to systematise their evaluation of different aspects.

**Diagnostic Assessment**: Pre-assessment to identify students'
existing knowledge, skills, and learning needs before instruction
begins. Examples include pre-tests and initial interviews.

**Formative Assessment:** Ongoing assessment conducted during the
learning process to provide feedback and guide instruction.

- Exit Tickets: Quick questions or prompts at the end of a lesson to
assess understanding.

- Think-Pair-Share: Students think about a question, discuss it with a
partner, then share their thoughts with the class.

- Polls or Surveys: Use technology to collect real-time feedback on
student understanding.

- One-Minute Papers: Ask students to summarise key concepts in one
minute.

**Summative Assessment:** Assessment conducted at the end of a unit,
semester, or course to measure overall learning outcomes.

- Examples: Final exams, standardised tests, end-of-course projects or
presentations.

## Tools

Common evaluation tools include:

**1. Rubrics:** Clear guidelines outlining criteria and expectations for
assignments, projects, or performances. Rubrics help provide consistent
feedback and assessment. Rubrics provide detailed descriptions of what
constitutes different levels of performance for each criterion.

- Examples: Rubrics for writing assignments, speaking assessments,
project evaluations.

**2. Self-Assessment:** Students assess their own learning progress and
performance against set criteria. This promotes metacognition and helps
students take ownership of their learning.

- Examples: Self-reflection journals, self-assessment checklists,
goal-setting activities.

**3.** **Peer Assessment:** Students evaluate the work of their peers
based on established criteria. This promotes collaboration, critical
thinking, and provides diverse perspectives.

- Examples: Peer editing of essays, peer review of presentations, group
project evaluations.

**4. Quizzes and Tests:** Structured assessments with specific questions
designed to measure knowledge, understanding, and skills in particular
areas. They can be multiple-choice, true/false, fill-in-the-blank, short
answer, or essay format.

**5. Portfolios:** Collections of student work over time that
demonstrate progress, achievements, and areas for improvement.
Portfolios can include written assignments, projects, reflections, and
other evidence of learning.

**6. Oral Assessments:** Evaluations of speaking skills through
interviews, presentations, role-plays, and discussions. These tools
measure fluency, pronunciation, coherence, and engagement.

**7. Listening Exercises:** Activities that assess students' ability to
understand spoken language, such as listening to audio recordings and
answering comprehension questions.

**8. Observations:** Informal assessments where teachers monitor and
record students' behaviours, participation, and interactions in the
classroom. Observations help identify strengths and areas needing
improvement.

**9. Standardised Tests:** Externally created assessments that measure
students' performance against national or international benchmarks.
Examples include TOEFL, IELTS, and Cambridge English exams.

Effective evaluation strategies integrate various tools to create a
comprehensive assessment plan. By combining formative and summative
evaluations, using diverse tools, and aligning assessments with learning
objectives, educators can obtain a holistic understanding of students'
abilities and progress. This integration ensures that assessments are
fair, reliable, and valid, ultimately enhancing the teaching and
learning process.

# USING RUBRICS IN EFL CLASS

Rubrics are highly effective tools for assessing student performance in
language classes. They provide clear criteria for evaluation and ensure
consistency in grading, making the assessment process more transparent
for both students and teachers. Here's how you can use rubrics in
different language learning contexts:

## How to create rubrics:

1. Identify Learning Objectives: Determine the specific language
*skills* or competencies you want to assess, such as speaking,
listening, writing, or reading comprehension.

2. Define Criteria: Break down each skill into measurable criteria. For
example, *criteria* for assessing speaking skills might include
pronunciation, fluency, vocabulary usage, grammar accuracy, and
coherence.

3. Develop Descriptors: Create *descriptors* for each level of
performance within each criterion. Clearly articulate what distinguishes
Excellent, Good, Fair, and Poor performance.

4. Design Rubric Format: Organise the criteria and descriptors into a
clear and easy-to-read format. You can use a table format with criteria
listed vertically and performance levels listed horizontally.

:::caution
Bear in mind: skills\> criteria\> descriptors\> table
:::

## How to use rubrics:

1. Introduce Rubrics to Students: Explain the purpose and structure of
the rubric to students. Provide examples and discuss each criterion and
performance level to ensure understanding.

2. Provide Clear Instructions: Clearly communicate the task or
assignment requirements to students, along with the criteria by which
their performance will be evaluated.

3. Use Rubrics for Assessment: During assessment, use the rubric to
evaluate student performance. Assess each criterion separately and
assign scores based on the corresponding descriptors.

4. Offer Feedback and Reflection: Provide specific feedback to students
based on the rubric. Highlight areas of strength and areas needing
improvement, referencing the criteria and descriptors.

    - **Individual Feedback:** Offer individual feedback to each student, focusing
on specific areas identified in the rubric.
    - **Group Feedback:** Provide general feedback to the class, summarising
common strengths and areas for improvement.
    - **Reflection:** Encourage students to reflect on their performance and set
goals for future improvement.

5. Discuss Results: After assessment, discuss the results with
students. Review the rubric together and provide explanations for the
scores assigned. Encourage students to ask questions and seek
clarification.

Some options to be used in class:

- Encourage Self-Assessment: Encourage students to self-assess their
work using the rubric. This promotes metacognition and helps students
understand their strengths and weaknesses.

- Peer Assessment: Incorporate peer assessment by having students
evaluate each other's work using the rubric. This encourages
collaboration and helps students develop a deeper understanding of the
evaluation criteria.

## Benefits of Using Rubrics:

-   Clarity and Transparency: Rubrics provide clear expectations and criteria for assessment, making the evaluation process transparent for students.

-   Consistency: Rubrics ensure consistency in grading by providing standardised criteria for assessment, reducing bias and subjectivity.

-   Feedback: Rubrics facilitate detailed and constructive feedback, helping students understand their strengths and areas for improvement.

-   Goal Setting: Rubrics help students set goals for their learning by providing clear benchmarks for performance.

-   Self-Assessment and Reflection: Rubrics encourage self-assessment and reflection, empowering students to take ownership of their learning process.

By incorporating rubrics into language classes, teachers can effectively
assess student performance, provide meaningful feedback, and support
student learning and development.

# EVALUATION STRATEGY EXPLORATION

The objective of this section is to explore various evaluation
strategies used in EFL teaching and understand their application.

You'll find here a set of case studies, each presenting a different
teaching scenario.

## Case Study 1: Teaching Vocabulary to Beginners.

Imagine you are teaching a beginner-level English class, and you want to
assess how well your students have learned basic vocabulary related to
daily routines.

> The **evaluation strategy** chosen would be a **Performance-Based Assessment.** Performance-based assessment is an effective strategy for beginners because it allows students to demonstrate their vocabulary knowledge through practical and interactive activities. This strategy focuses on students' ability to use vocabulary in real-life contexts, providing a more accurate measure of their language acquisition.


Tool: *Role-Play Activities*

Why? Role-play activities are engaging and interactive tools that
encourage students to use new vocabulary in a meaningful way. By acting
out daily routines, students can practise and demonstrate their
understanding of the vocabulary in context.

Tool: *Picture-Based Vocabulary Quiz.*

Why? A picture-based vocabulary quiz would be effective for beginners as
it aligns with their proficiency level and learning objectives. It
allows students to demonstrate their understanding of vocabulary in
context, without relying heavily on reading or writing skills. This
strategy is engaging and provides a visual aid for comprehension.

## Case Study 2: Assessing Speaking Skills of Intermediate-Level Students.

Imagine you have an intermediate-level English class, and you want to
assess students' speaking skills in a conversational setting.

The **evaluation strategy** chosen would be a *Performance Assessment with Rubrics*

Performance assessment with rubrics allows for a detailed evaluation of
students' speaking skills based on specific criteria. This strategy
provides structured feedback and ensures consistency in assessment.

Tool: *Structured Speaking Tasks with Rubrics*

Why? Structured speaking tasks provide students with clear guidelines
for their speaking performance, while rubrics offer a systematic way to
evaluate their skills across various criteria.
